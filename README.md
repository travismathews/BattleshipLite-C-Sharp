# BattleshipLite

A simple, console-based implementation of the classic Battleship game in C#.

## üìù Description

BattleshipLite is a two-player console application where each player places ships on a grid and takes turns guessing the location of the opponent‚Äôs ships. The first player to sink all enemy ships wins!

## üéØ Core Learning Concepts

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Use of classes and models to represent players, ships, and the game grid.
- **Collections:** Managing lists for ship locations and shots.
- **Input Validation:** Ensuring valid user input for ship placement and shots.
- **Game Logic:** Turn-based play, win condition checks, and result display.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Dividing responsibilities between the UI (console) and game logic layers.
